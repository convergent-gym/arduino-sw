# Swole Control Arduino Software (Microcontroller Software)

The code in this repo contains the logic for our hardware which reads the distance to the nearest object from our distance sensor and then sends it to our API where the data will be processed and then shown to end-users. 

This software is written in a variant of C++ which is specific to Arduino-based systems.
