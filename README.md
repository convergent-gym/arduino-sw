# arduino-sw

/*we got our arduino and stuff working, I think?

Plan: enable distance sensors

create app that takes input and reads if machine is busy depending on input from sonar sensors

calculates business at any given time and shows to user on app

I actually don't know how this is supposed to work but it be like that

App will probably be React native
